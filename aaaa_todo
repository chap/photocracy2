High Priority
  don't automatically create "ideas" when creating a question
  question choices are being created with a trailing \n
  
Lower Priority
  remove earl
  move voting from question controller to promts
  better separation of analytics
    -abingo
    -click tracking
  grouping reporting in a logical way (separate into it's own class/lib)

Done
  refactor prompts#vote_left to just vote
